# TensorFlow

In this section we will examine the fully connected neural network (NN) in TensorFlow, rather than PyTorch.

**TensorFlow** is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It is used for building and deploying machine learning models. See [the documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

**TensorFlow** does have GPU support, therefore can be used train complicated neural network model that require a lot of GPU power.

TensorFlow is also interoperable with other packages discussed so far, datatypes from NumPy and pandas are often used in TensorFlow.

Here we will import all the required TensorFlow libraries for the rest of the tutorial.

~~~
from tensorflow import keras # tensorflow wrapper
from tensorflow.random import set_seed # import set_seed function for TensorFlow
set_seed(seed_value) # set TensorFlow random seed
~~~
{: .language-python}

From the previous pages, we already have our data in NumPy arrays, like `X`, that can be used in TensorFlow.

## Model training

To use a neural network with TensorFlow, we modularize its construction using a function. We will later pass this function into a Keras wrapper.

~~~
def build_model(n_hidden=1, n_neurons=5, learning_rate=1e-3): # function to build a neural network model
    # Build
    model = keras.models.Sequential() # initialise the model
    for layer in range(n_hidden): # loop over hidden layers
        model.add(keras.layers.Dense(n_neurons, activation="relu")) # add layer to your model
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')) # add output layer
    # Compile
    optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=learning_rate) # define the optimizer
    model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy']) # compile your model
    return model
~~~
{: .language-python}

For now, ignore all the complicated hyperparameters, but note that the loss used is `sparse_categorical_crossentropy`; the neural network uses gradient descent to optimize its parameters (in this case these parameters are *neuron weights*).

We need to keep some events for validation. Validation sets are used to select and tune the final neural network model.

~~~
X_valid_scaled, X_train_nn_scaled = X_train_scaled[:100], X_train_scaled[100:] # first 100 events for validation
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Challenge
> Assign the first 100 events in y_train for validation (`y_valid`) and the rest for training your neural network (`y_train_nn`).
>
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > y_valid, y_train_nn = y_train[:100], y_train[100:] # first 100 events for validation
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

With these parameters, the network can be trained as follows:

~~~
tf_clf = keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasClassifier(build_model) # call the build_model function defined earlier
tf_clf.fit(X_train_nn_scaled, y_train_nn, validation_data=(X_valid_scaled, y_valid)) # fit your neural network
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Challenge
> Get the predicted y values for the TensorFlow neural network, `y_pred_tf`.
> Once you have `y_pred_tf`, see how well your TensorFlow neural network classifier does using accurarcy_score.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ~~~
> > y_pred_tf = tf_clf.predict(X_test_scaled) # make predictions on the test data
> >
> > # See how well the classifier does
> > print(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_tf))
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

The TensorFlow neural network should also have a similar accuracy score to the PyTorch neural network.

## Overfitting check
