# What is Machine Learning?

General definition

<ul>
[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
  <ul>
    -Arthur Samuel, 1959
  </ul>
</ul>

In a **traditional approach** to solving problems, one would study a problem, write rules (i.e. laws of physics) to solve that problem, analyze errors, then modify the rules. A **machine learning approach** automates this process: *a machine learning model modifies its rules based on the errors it measures*.

<ul>
  For example, consider `$z = x + y_i$` fitting some data \\( (x_i, y_i) \\) to a quadratic curve $y=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, one might define the error to be the difference of squares: namely $`\sum_i (y_i-(ax_i^2+bx_i+c))`$. This error function depends on 3 input parameters $a$, $`b`$ and $`c`$. Once can tweak these parameters to **minimize the loss function**.
